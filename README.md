- **Dynamic Hexagon Grid**: 8 interactively styled hexagons housing DevOps-related icons (Azure, GitLab, Sync, Helm, Rocket, etc.).
- **Interlocking Infinity Logo**: A custom-engineered SVG infinity loop with:
  - **Circular Design**: Perfectly balanced "round" (gul) loops.
  - **Interlocking Gaps**: Animated mask-based arrow gaps (`>`) that move along the path.
  - **Smooth Gradients**: 8 distinct segment gradients creating a vibrant, fluid motion.

- **CSS3 (Vanilla)**: For advanced animations, `clip-path`, and responsive layout.
- **SVG**: For complex vector paths and high-performance mask animations.
- **CSS Offset-Path**: Used to synchronize the interlocking arrows with the loop animation.
